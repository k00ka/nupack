# nupack solution by k00ka (David Andrews)

Two files:  
nupack.rb - the entire solution  
nupack_spec.rb - RSpec unit tests for the above

Releases:  
1.0 - base functionality - simple and straightforward solution  
1.1 - refactor to use an abstract factory - benefits by separating Products from Package (but scores higher on flog) :(
